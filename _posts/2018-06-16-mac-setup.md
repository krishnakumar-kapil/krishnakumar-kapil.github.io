Hate it or love it, every programmer has their own setup for coding, writing, and life in general. I'm the type of person who tries to optimize every part of tasks or things that I keep having to do. This guide is partially going to be a guide for how to get my setup transferred to another computer, as I've been running on this machine for quite a while and have accumulated a whole bunch of goodies that I may not remember.

# Mac Apps

1. [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/latest)
    - Settings on github.
    - Install settings:
        1. 
        ```

        mkdir ~/prog_settings
        mv ~/kapil_dotfiles/prog_settings/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist ~/prog_settings
        ```
        2. Go to iTerm and in General > Preferences, there should be a load preferences from pane where set `~/prog_settings/` as the loading folder.

1. Terminal Boosters

## Vim

To just copy/install my vim setup:
```
git clone https://github.com/krishnakumar-kapil/vim.git ~/kapil_dotfiles/
mv ~/.vimrc ~/.old_vimrc
mv ~/kapil_dotfiles/.vimrc ~
vim +PluginInstall +qall
```

### Why Vim?
Yes, I'm one of the people who uses vim and will advocate it to every coder I meet. I started using Vim around two and a half years ago after I realized that my coding speed was quite slow relative to some of my friends who used vim. Their hands would literally fly across the keyboard whilst generating lines upon lines of code in extremely short amounts of time. At the time, I was using the popular [Sublime Text](), but I was looking for something more powerful.

Vim's editing capabilities allow me to get the power of a normal typing processor like Word or Sublime, but also get incredibly optimized movement power. The primary reason for it is Normal Mode's forward word and backward capabilities that make it incredibly quick to move through long lines of code. The f/t keys are also really useful for jumping to the next character in that line. So, jumping to the next bracket or deleting till the next bracket is incredibly simple.

Vim's other big benefit is being present on every unix machine. This means that the editor you are most comfortable with is on every server and is accessible via ssh. In combination with tmux, this ensures that I have everything I need when coding in a single window.

The downside is that to get comfortable with most of the keybindings, it just takes a decent amount of time. **Vimtutor**, the default tutorial with vim run by just using `:vimtutor`, was how I got proficient with many of the keybindings. Other friends who used vim were also useful to my journey as I learnt more keybindings and got more useful plugins from them.

## Plugins

My setup in vim originally came from *[vim-as-an-ide](https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide)*. I've since then modified it quite a bit with my own list of plugins and other tools. 

### 1. Vundle
The core of the setup uses the plugin manager [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```
Adding more plugins is super easy with additions of the form `Plugin '<plugin-git-username>/<plugin-name>'` as seen below:
```
Plugin 'altercation/vim-colors-solarized'
```
After a plugin has been added to the .vimrc, run `vim` and then **`:PluginInstall`**.

### 2. Colorscheme Setup ([Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized))
- Add `Plugin 'altercation/vim-colors-solarized` in the plugin section.
- Settings: 
```
set background=dark
colorscheme solarized
```

### 3. [Vim Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
- Add `Plugin 'bling/vim-airline'` in the plugin section.
- Add `Plugin 'vim-airline/vim-airline-themes'` in the plugin section.
- Settings:
```
let g:airline_theme='badwolf'
set laststatus=2
let g:airline_powerline_fonts = 1
let g:airline_detect_paste=1
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled = 1
hi clear SignColumn
let g:airline#extensions#hunks#non_zero_only = 1
```
- Used for creating the really nice status bar at the bottom of vim.

### 4. Nerdtree
- One of the best file bars in vim. It opens up a tab on the side that shows the files in the directory.
- Add `Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdtree'` in plugin section.
- Settings:
    ```
    nmap <silent> <leader>t :NERDTreeTabsToggle<CR>
    let g:nerdtree_tabs_open_on_console_startup = 0
    let NERDTreeIgnore = ['\.pyc$', 'build', 'venv', 'egg', 'egg-info/', 'docs', '\.javac']
    autocmd bufenter * if (winnr("$") == 1 && exists("b:NERDTree") && b:NERDTree.isTabTree()) | q | endif
    ```
- Have nerdtree bar open up with `\t` and not open up on startup of vim.
- ignore files.
- close vim if nerdtree is the only window open.

### 5. Nerdcommentor
- Used for commenting in vim
- I use the setting `\c<space>` to toggle comment multiple lines.
- Add `Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdcommenter'`
- Settings:
    ```
    let g:NERDSpaceDelims = 1
    let g:NERDCompactSexyComs = 1
    let g:NERDCommentEmptyLines = 1
    let g:NERDTrimTrailingWhitespace = 1
    ```

### 6. Tags
```
Plugin 'xolox/vim-easytags'
Plugin 'xolox/vim-misc'
Plugin 'majutsushi/tagbar'
```
- I use tags as a way to quickly jump through code sections. I use exhuberant ctags to get this setup.
- To Install: 
    ```
    wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ctags/ctags-5.8.tar.gz
    tar -xzf ctags-5.8.tar.gz
    rm ctags-5.8.tar.gz
    cd ctags-5.8
    ./configure
    make
    ```
- Tagbar is the way I open up the function headers in vim quickly
- Settings:
    ```
    " ----- xolox/vim-easytags settings -----
    " Where to look for tags files
    set tags=./tags;,~/.vimtags
    " Sensible defaults
    let g:easytags_events = ['BufReadPost', 'BufWritePost']
    let g:easytags_async = 1
    let g:easytags_dynamic_files = 2
    let g:easytags_resolve_links = 1
    let g:easytags_suppress_ctags_warning = 1

    " ----- majutsushi/tagbar settings -----
    " Open/close tagbar with \b
    nmap <silent> <leader>f :TagbarToggle<CR>
    " Uncomment to open tagbar automatically whenever possible
    " autocmd BufEnter * nested :call tagbar#autoopen(0)
    let g:tagbar_autofocus = 1
    ```

### 7. Searching In Files
```
Plugin 'kien/ctrlp.vim'
Plugin 'dyng/ctrlsf.vim'
```
- I use ctrlp to search for file names within a project. The settings command ignores gitignored files, which become extremely handy when dealing with build files.
- Settings:
    ```
    let g:ctrlp_user_command = ['.git/', 'git --git-dir=%s/.git ls-files -oc --exclude-standard']
    nmap     <C-F>f <Plug>CtrlSFPrompt
    vmap     <C-F>f <Plug>CtrlSFVwordPath
    vmap     <C-F>F <Plug>CtrlSFVwordExec
    nmap     <C-F>n <Plug>CtrlSFCwordPath
    nmap     <C-F>p <Plug>CtrlSFPwordPath
    nnoremap <C-F>o :CtrlSFOpen<CR>
    nnoremap <C-F>t :CtrlSFToggle<CR>
    inoremap <C-F>t <Esc>:CtrlSFToggle<CR>
    ```
- Use `Ctrl-F f` for searching across directory similar to sublime's ctrl shift f functionality.

### 8. Language Specific Plugins
- **vim-go**
    - The ultimate plugin for dev with golang. 
    - Amazing options for going to function, variable, and struct definitions. 
    - `Plugin 'fatih/vim-go'`
    - Good syntax highlighting
    - gofmt is a lifesaver since golang breaks on certain build errors like unused libraries, etc.
- jedi-vim
    - Similar to vim-go but for python development.
    - Isn't as good as vim-go because of the core differences of the language, but is able to replicate most of the features comfortably.
    - Plugin 'davidhalter/jedi-vim'
- csv-vim
    - Not necessary, but makes viewing csv files in vim possible and easy than using bulky excel.

### 9. Typing/Writing Features
- `Plugin 'Raimondi/delimitMate'`
    - Used for auto-completing brackets and quotes.
    - Settings:
        ```
        let delimitMate_expand_cr = 1
        augroup mydelimitMate
          au!
          au FileType markdown let b:delimitMate_nesting_quotes = ["`"]
          au FileType tex let b:delimitMate_quotes = ""
          au FileType tex let b:delimitMate_matchpairs = "(:),[:],{:},`:'"
          au FileType python let b:delimitMate_nesting_quotes = ['"', "'"]
        augroup END
        ```
- `Plugin 'reedes/vim-pencil'`
    - Used when I'm writing markdown documents or other documents where I don't want vim's janky multi-line movement. SoftPencil allows the ability to use hjkl movement on single line comments, which ends up being very useful since I tend to write paragraphs in a single line for notes or for longer documents.
- `Plugin 'junegunn/goyo.vim'`
    - Distraction free writing tool that hides a lot of the status information and allows pure focus for writing. Allows extremely clean typing mode.
    - I use this in conjunction with Limelight, which highlights the current writing paragraph for even more focus.
```
Plugin 'plasticboy/vim-markdown'
Plugin 'dkarter/bullets.vim'
```
    - Both are used to make bullets and markdown in general a pleasure to use.
    - Settings:
        ```
        let g:vim_markdown_folding_style_pythonic = 1
        let g:vim_markdown_math = 1
        let g:vim_markdown_folding_disabled = 1
        set conceallevel=2
        " Bullets.vim
        let g:bullets_enabled_file_types = [
            \ 'markdown',
            \ 'text',
            \ 'gitcommit',
            \ 'scratch'
            \]
        ```


### 10. Git
```
Plugin 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
```
- Gitgutter: 
    - Shows which line were modified in the sidebar of vim. Super useful to figure out which lines you have modified maybe by accident in your code, or to provide more context when coding in multiple areas in a file.
- fugitive:
    - git wrapper around vim that I don't use that much as I prefer using the command line to get access to my git stuff.

### 11. Syntax
- syntastic
    - `Plugin 'vim-syntastic/syntastic'`
    - Settings:
    ```
	let g:syntastic_error_symbol = '✘'
	let g:syntastic_warning_symbol = "▲"
	let g:syntastic_always_populate_loc_list = 0
	let g:syntastic_auto_loc_list = 0
	let g:syntastic_check_on_open = 1
	let g:syntastic_check_on_wq = 0
	augroup mySyntastic
	  au!
	  au FileType tex let b:syntastic_mode = "passive"
	augroup END
	let g:syntax_matlab_mlint_exec="/Applications/MATLAB_R2016b.app/bin/maci64/mlint"
    ```
    - One of the best syntax checkers for multiple languages out there. It's quite useful for most languages, but I tend to keep the auto loading the location list off as it got quite annoying with my habit to constantly save files after making any changes.


### Misc Plugins
- `Plugin 'christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator'`
    - A must plugin that I use for moving between vim splits and tmux panes in the same window. Works quite well with my current setup.
- `Plugin 'vim-scripts/a.vim'`
    - Used for switching between alternate files in c or c++. Like if you have foo.h and foo.c then you can switch between them using `:A`.
- Spell Checking
    ```
    autocmd FileType latex,tex,md,markdown setlocal spell
    autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.md setlocal spell
    ```
