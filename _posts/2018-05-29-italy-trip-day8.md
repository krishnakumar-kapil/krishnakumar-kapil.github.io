## [Duomo di Milano](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Milan_Cathedral)

After breakfast, we headed over to Milano Centrale to catch our hop on hop off bus tour. Our first tourist stop was the Duomo di Milano, the famous cathedral in Milan. The entrance area of the Duomo has a large Piazza where the size of the Duomo can be truly appreciated, unlike some of the other Cathedrals we have seen.

The cathedral took 600 years to complete fully and is the largest in main Italy (St. Peter's Basilica is in Vatican City) and the third largest in the world. The Duomo's main features are the intricate pinnacles and spires present on the roof of the cathedral. The pillars inside the cathedral are massive stone pillars that are 24.5 meters high. The massive height of the cathedral allowed large glass paintings on the windows in the cathedral. One of the main sculptures is a golden Madonna at the top of the main spire on the roof of the cathedral. The Duomo also has an underground crypt that is home to the bodies of Archbishops Ottone and Giovanni Visconte. 

To go up to the roof and the museum, we had to buy yet another ticket. The museum had a lot of models of the Duomo in addition to sculptures by both professional artists as well as students during the time of construction of the cathedral.

## Piz

Post Appa 'soaking' in more art at the museum, we headed for lunch to [Piz]() on the recommendation of a friend. Out of all the restaurants in Italy, if there is only one you can go to I would recommend Piz. When you first get to the restaurant (it's in a bit of an alleyway), if you aren't immediately seated they serve you with a slice of pizza with a glass of white sparkling wine. Their table turnover rate was also really impressive and we were seated within no time even at around peak hour of 1 pm. We were seated in the colorful basement of the restaurant that was converted from a wine cellar, as per reviews I'd read before. As 3 vegetarians, it was such a pleasure to see a menu with only 3 dishes and all vegetarian. The 3 dishes were: their famous Margherita, a chive based tomato pizza, and one last pizza that's slipping my mind. The pizzas were absolutely incredible! The quality of the ingredients and the crust really made them the best pizzas we had in Italy. We finished off our meal with a perfect tiramisu, before being pleasantly surprised when we were served fennel shots. As Indian *sauf* lovers, this was an amazing way to end the meal, though we couldn't finish the full alcohol haha. The people at Piz were so kind that when we were trying to pay at the cashier they forced more shots on us after we said we liked them! 

## Sforzesco Castle and Museum

We had seen yesterday that the castle had free entry on Tuesdays after 2 pm. Being stingy, we grabbed onto the opportunity and got to see the full museum. I think at this point, my mother and I were done with art museums while my dad continued to 'soak' in the paintings haha.

Post the museum, we were craving for some gelato and headed to [Vanila Milano](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Galleria+Vittorio+Emanuele+II/@45.4862671,9.2016725,16z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x4786c3f8853adc1d:0x192dc3c5f4975b72!2sPorta+Nuova!8m2!3d45.4798874!4d9.1925959!3m4!1s0x0:0x270b9ca95809d416!8m2!3d45.4658431!4d9.1899401) for the best gelato on our whole trip!! All their flavors were natural and organic, which meant that their mango gelato was from actual mangos and was one of the best ice creams I've ever had. I had that in combination with their chocolate hazelnut flavored *bacchio*. We would highly recommend this place to anyone!

Post gelato-bliss, we wanted to roam the city in the hop on hop off tour bus that would end at 6 pm. While I slept and then read (shout out to Arcane Ascension series), my parents enjoyed the rest of the city architecture. We eventually called it a day by going back to the hotel with some groceries and making a small meal there.
