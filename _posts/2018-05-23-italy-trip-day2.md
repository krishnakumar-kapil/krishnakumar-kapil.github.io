We had started off the day at Hotel Centro. While my parents wake up really early (6:00 am) on holidays, this day was special where we all slept in till 9 am. After that just getting ready and having breakfast brought us to 11 am. The breakfast in Italy generally was a boatload of sweet items like croissants and baked goods with some untoasted bread. We were lucky that every hotel had cereal, fruits and thankfully yoghurt :O.

We started our tourism for the day by going to see [Basilica Papale di Santa Maria Maggiore](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Basilica+Papale+di+Santa+Maria+Maggiore/@41.8980089,12.4972263,18z/data=!4m16!1m8!3m7!1s0x132f61af5a97eb77:0xeb5107cdce01d746!2sHotel+Centro!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.9009077!4d12.4949035!3m6!1s0x132f61a4db7d30d7:0xf7b354fb8f8c357a!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.897599!4d12.498408) from the outside.

### Spanish Steps

</div>


The [Spanish Steps](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spanish_Steps) are an extremely popular site for tourists to go to. They are extremely crowded and are basically impossible to get a clean shot of in daytime. While my mom was raving about having to see the steps during the last 2 days, it turned out quite the disappointment from the bottom. The steps were just ordinary marble without decoration. I think I was more impressed by the [Grandview Park in SF](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grandview+Park/@37.7564084,-122.4739283,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808587602e7a2d15:0x6957dbab1942eef7!8m2!3d37.7564084!4d-122.4717396). The grouping of the steps were in sets of 12. With only 135 steps, this wasn't even close to some of the other structures we visited in Italy.

However, we did get our first view over the whole of Rome at the top of the Spanish Steps. At the top, there is a church where we couldn't take pictures unfortunately. As usual, Appa was 'soaking' in the paintings inside while Amma and I were getting restless to see other places before we had to leave for our Vatican tour.

### Borghese Garden

As the navigator throughout the trip, I started guiding the family towards the Borghese gardens. On the way, we got to see even better Vista Points of Rome. The gardens themselves were lush with greenery. Instead of the trimmed top heavy trees seen throughout Italy, the gardens had trees that we were more familiar with.

</div>

After the Borghese Gardens we started heading west towards the Vatican. Along the way we got lunch at a small cafe called [Mondo Arancina](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mondo+Arancina/@41.9118113,12.4745687,17z/data=!4m16!1m8!3m7!1s0x132f61af5a97eb77:0xeb5107cdce01d746!2sHotel+Centro!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.9009077!4d12.4949035!3m6!1s0x0:0x48b559442fe000c4!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.912934!4d12.4755717) that was truly bustling. We managed to get a great deal for a pizza, a fried rice ball, and a dessert called [Cannoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannoli).


After lunch, we got a chance to visit the [Piazza del Popolo](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Piazza_del_Popolo). With two churches on either side of the main obelisk in an extremely wide area, it was an incredible 360 view. After the piazza, we crossed the famous [River Tiber](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tiber) which is known to be the birthplace of Rome by the twin brothers Romulus and Remus. Our first time on the west side of the Tiber River, we managed to walk on a road just filled with expensive fashion shops. One of the names was extremely funny :P.

### Bathrooms and Water

Before we arrived at our destination, the ever concerning toilet break had to be taken by Appa who quickly went to a McDonald's 5 minutes away while my mother tension's rose and rose. The lack of public toilets in Italy ended up being quite a frustration throughout the trip since basic malls, shops, and train stations just didn't have these facilities. 

Another source of frustration was the lack of free drinking water in the nation. Hotels and restaurants just didn't provide water and expected the customers to pay for bottled water. Even if we brought our own bottled water, in certain places they made us pay for their bottled water. 

### Vatican Museum

We started the tour by heading to the Vatican Museum that had a huge line outside. Luckily, we had got the Skip-the-line-Tickets that allowed us to go with an official tour guide and as the name suggests: skip the line. With the skip-the-line tickets we also had the advantage of not having to bring our passports for ID verification (dad made the right call to not bring them much to my chagrin).

</div>

Our tour guide initially brought us to a foyer with this pine-cone structure and the metallic earth structure. The museum was one long corridor that culminated in the Sistine Chapel. Along the corridor, most of the ceilings were painted in a fashion to give a 3-d look to the paintings that was extremely realistic. I ended up looking at each ceiling that looked 3-d in the future to check if it was actually sculpted or painted.

    The tapestries seen were all handwoven and done to incredible detail.

My favorite room has to be the map room. Along the walls, incredibly detailed topography maps of the parts of Italy were hand painted. The ceiling was an amalgamation of beautiful paintings with the framing all done in gold to give an opulent and indulgent feel to the room

Our trip got slightly delayed because a couple, who funnily thought Appa was a television anchor from Minnesota, got separated during the mad chaos of the crowd. The group has to follow the tour guide's flag that they carry in their hands.

            However, our tour guide didn't hold it high enough haha and Amma suggested holding it higher upon which the tour guide happily handed it to Appa to hold. I got roped in when the tour guide had to go get the official tickets for the Vatican. Unfortunately, we were unpaid in our meaningful contributions.

</div>


### [Sistine Chapel](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sistine_Chapel)

Unfortunately, it is prohibited to take pictures in the Chapel itself. The Chapel is a magnificent piece of art with each wall and the ceiling painted in masterpieces with the dominant color being blue of the sky. Each group gets such little time to look at the various paintings. Michelangelo's famous [The Last Judgement]("https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Last_Judgment_(Michelangelo)") adorns the altar wall of the Chapel.

### [St. Peter's Basilica](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/St._Peter%27s_Basilica)

<div class="item right">
    <img data-src="{{ 'assets/images/blog/italy_trip/day2/basilica_ceiling.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="blog-image">
    <figcaption>Basilica Ceiling</figcaption>
</div>

The longest catholic church in the world. Though you can't tell when you visit, the Basilica is actually in the form of a crucifix. It is a really incredible site with an incredibly long lead-up to the main dome. The main corridor has an arch ceiling with these consistent rectangular patterns that managed to expose the height and size of the Basilica. Unlike other Basilicas that have circular pillars, St. Peter's Basilica has rectangular pillars with engravings of what seemed to be griffins at the top of them. In addition, these pillars are present in the foyer of the basilica. The main corridor of the basilica also has a list of the largest churches in the world on it's floor. Naturally, St. Peter's Basilica is the largest.

    <img data-src="{{ 'assets/images/blog/italy_trip/day2/pieta.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="blog-image">
    <figcaption>Michelangelo's Pieta</figcaption>
</div>

Even the side corridors are substantially more impressive and decorated than normal. One of them has a Chapel where weddings could be held if and only if you have connections with the Pope or the cardinals. Another famous sculpture present in these halls is Michelangelo's [Pieta]("https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Piet%C3%A0_(Michelangelo)").

The main dome of the Basilica was designed by Michelangelo. The altar is a reference to the confession of faith by St. Peter, that led to his martyrdom. Each of the letters around the dome are 1.4 feet tall that spell out 
*TV ES PETRVS ET SVPER HANC PETRAM AEDIFICABO ECCLESIAM MEAM. TIBI DABO CLAVES REGNI CAELORVM*
(... you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church. ... I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ... Vulgate, Matthew 16:18–19.)*

After taking in the sites of the Vatican, our tour guide naturally dropped us off at the pervasive souvenir shop, where we naturally bought nothing and used the thankfully free bathrooms (Yes Kapil, it was quite a challenge finding them). We then headed back towards the River Tiber, getting a chance to see the [Caste Sant'Angelo](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Castel_Sant%27Angelo).

We walked down to the river side to see it was just as dirty from above as it was upclose. The greenish tinge was present in other rivers that we saw in Italy, though the sea itself was quite clear as seen on the Amalfi Coast. On the Vatican Side of the river, we got to also see the magnificent [Supreme Court of Italy]("https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Supreme_Court_of_Cassation_(Italy)").

#### Busses and Cigarettes
After walking this long, we really wanted to just bus to the other side of the city to see the Baths of Caracella and the Circus Massimo. To use the bus in Italy, you have to already have a bus ticket prior to when you board the bus. The most convenient place to buy a bus ticket was a tobacco store.

The sheer usage of cigarettes and tobacco in Italy blew our minds. While Italy is the 34th in the world for [per capita tobacco usage](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_countries_by_cigarette_consumption_per_capita), we had never heard of this until arriving in the country. It was truly impossible for me to walk around on the city streets without someone or the other smoking a cigarette. It seems to be a big problem in the country as people would start getting their cigarettes and lighters out as the A/C train (where you can't smoke) slowed down for a station. Unlike most airports, Italy is one of the few remaining that still has a dedicated smoking box, that was extremely crowded.

Anyway, the system is that you buy the bus tickets and then get them authenticated on the bus on a ticket machine. The tickets would work for 100 minutes (I have no clue how they came with that value) after the point of authentication for that day.

---
The [Circus Massimo](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Circus_Maximus) ended up being quite disappointing. It was just an empty sand field with a nice backdrop of the Roman Forum. There was a nice botanical garden next to the field which my mom wanted to go see. We went to see the Baths of Caracello but they were closed by the time we went there :(, and there wasn't much to see outside of them.

### Dinner

    <figcaption class="margin-bottom">Basilica Papale di Santa Maria Maggiore At Night</figcaption>
</div>


We had our dinner at [Trettoria Cecio](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trattoria+Cecio/@41.8983958,12.4990176,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x132f61a37e0230b7:0x95d46bed75a733b3!8m2!3d41.8983958!4d12.501206://www.google.com/maps/place/Trattoria+Cecio/@41.8983958,12.4990176,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x132f61a37e0230b7:0x95d46bed75a733b3!8m2!3d41.8983958!4d12.5012063) where we had some pasta again after a long wait to sit with people smoking next to us. It was some really good food, but I think after the amount we had walked that day anything would have been good. A note to all travellers to Italy, if you want to go to some of the better restaurants do not expect to be seated if you don't have a reservation. These reservations had to be atleast a day in advance for dinner. It happened so many times where I'd find a nice restaurant, call them only to find out that they wouldn't take us for that day. Since our timing tended to be variable, it wasn't possible for us to eat at some of the highest rated places during our trip. However, I do think we found some incredible places.

After dinner, my parents their dose of daily gelato and we all headed back to another day of questionable wifi at Hotel Centro.
