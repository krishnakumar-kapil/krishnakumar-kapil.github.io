**Summary**: Florence, Duomo, Santa Croce, Piazza Michelangelo, Pitti Palace, Boboli Gardens, Mercato di San Lorenzo

We start off our day kicking off from Hotel Leopolda on the west side of Florence. We had a whole bunch of jumbled up spots without a clear plan on how to tackle each of them and thus decided to just do a sweep from north to south of the city.

Our first stop of the day was the leather market of [Mercato di San Lorenzo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mercato+di+San+Lorenzo/@43.7771016,11.2457721,15z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x132a56a680d2d6ad:0x93d57917efc72a03!2sFlorence,+Metropolitan+City+of+Florence,+Italy!3b1!8m2!3d43.7695604!4d11.2558136!3m4!1s0x132a5402c636fdb3:0x8b723bbfcc8bab4b!8m2!3d43.7765303!4d11.2534493). Naturally, we didn't buy anything, though the sheer amount of duplicated leather products was baffling. Why did there have to be 20 different street vendors selling the same goods? Being a family of stingy Indians (part of whom worships cows), we didn't buy anything in a fashion market. In the market, there is a touristy food mall that we ended up going to for dinner, but it was a brilliant idea to convert an old industrial type setting into a fabulous urban tourist hub.

We also checked out [Basilica di San Lorenzo](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/San_Lorenzo,_Florence) but didn't go in as that required yet another ticket.

---

## [Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral)

The next stop was the Florence Cathedral or Duomo di Florence or Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore. It was confusing just to try to figure out what was the actual name that I should refer to this place as. Anyway, this cathedral was unique amongst the ones that we saw up till this point in our trip. Created through incredible polychrome marble panels using green and pink in a background of white. More than the intricate details of the structure, it is the massive scale of the structure that strikes out. The dome can basically be seen from every elevated point in Florence, and no building comes close to achieving the height of the dome or its bell tower.

    </div>
</div>

However, more ticketing woes afflicted us. To get inside the areas of the Duomo, you had to buy a ticket of around 18 euros per person. But, to see the insides of the main dome and climb to the top of the dome, one has to make a prior reservation and the earliest reservation was 2 days from when we were there sadly. We still bought the tickets since we could see the bell tower, museum, baptistry, and the crypts.

Note for Kapil and folks interested in books, this was around when I started getting really into Sufficiently Advanced Magic by Andrew Rowe.

    </div>
</div>

**Baptistry:** The baptistry was a smaller version of the dome with some more of the detailed paneling that we saw from the Uffizi Gallery yesterday. Unlike some of the other domes, it was clear that the lighting structures didn't allow as much light into the building that actually gave it a holier feeling.

        <p><strong>Bell Tower:</strong> The bell tower was right next to the main dome and has a massive 414 steps. To climb up the tower, we took a winding stone staircase that let us look at the massive view around Florence. There were 3 levels where there were viewpoints of the rest of the city. Sadly, all the views were caged up with metal. One of the bells was out on showcase after being restored since people used to write stuff on the surface of the bell.</p>

**Museum**: We tried going inside the cathedral, but it was closed due to mass. My mom and I got dragged by my dad to go to the museum of the Cathedral, that turned out to be quite nice. With quite a modern setup, it had this one massive hall with some amazing sculptures and lighting.

We headed for lunch to [Scuie Scuie](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sciue'Sciue'+-+Fritto,Pizza%26Vegano/@43.7683701,11.2595255,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x18d7e60d1cdcb6c4!8m2!3d43.7680841!4d11.260704). The lunch was not particularly anything great to talk about. We tried the calzone, lasagne, and another pasta dish which is slipping my mind.

</div>

After lunch, we headed to [Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence](). The church, whose paneling was similar to the Santa Maria Church, is the burial place for many famous artists like Michelangelo. Classically, we didn't go in since more tickets (\$\$\$\$ for days).

We then headed towards Piazza Michelangelo to see the majestic view of Florence. But since there was a climb, we just had to take a gelato break before jumping into the climb up the hill.

## [Piazza Michelangelo](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Piazzale_Michelangelo)

<div class="row">
    <div class="12u 12u$(mobile) item">

        <figcaption>David Sculpture Copy</figcaption>
    </div>
    <div class="8u 12u$(mobile) item">
        The piazza is on the south side of Florence at a height such that the whole of Florence is visible to the eyes. I think out of all the Piazzas we visited, Piazza Michelangelo was the most worthwhile and satisfying. We could see the Tuscan countryside and mountains from the Piazza with the red-roofed city of Florence. While we didn't get a chance to visit Accademia di Florence, where Michelangelo's David sculpture rests, Piazza Michelangelo is home to a bronze cast of the famous David sculpture. Many photos with the scenic background later, we headed to the Pitti Palace and the Boboli Gardens.

## [Pitti Palace](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Palazzo_Pitti)

The Pitti Palace is now a famous art gallery for Renaissance art. It was primarily the seat of the rulers of Tuscany and united Italy. The Palace was even used as a power base by Napolean Bonaparte. It is now the largest museum complex in Florence and has 28 rooms in the main Palatine Gallery.  Each of the 28 rooms in the gallery is decorated with incredible frescoes on the ceilings in addition to the multitude of paintings on each wall surface. This gallery, of around 500 paintings, was once a part of the Medici collection.

The Pitti Palace has many paintings commissioned by the famous [Medici Family](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/House_of_Medici). They were a famous banking family with large amounts of the political power in Italy in the 15th century. They provided the commissions to a majority of the famous artists in Florence like Michelangelo, Da Vinci. Powerful enough to become Popes, this family commissioned the works from Raphael as well as Michelangelo's work in the Sistine Chapel. Not limited to just art, they were also a patron of Galileo Galilei, who tutored the Medici children.

These gardens exist at the back of the Pitti Palace. They are home to some old sculptures but are now mainly just hedges and grass. At an incline, the height of the garden allows more great views of the city. A smaller flower garden is present near the top of the garden where we could see Piazza Michelangelo and more of the Tuscan countryside.

After our adventures on the south side of Florence, we wanted to head to [La Terezza]() to view the sunset. But, it was only 6 pm and the sunset happened at a late 8:50 pm. After killing sometime on the road outside the Pitti Palace, we ended up going to the Mercato di San Lorenzo market for dinner where we got some great veggie burgers and potato fries. 

I didn't check the closing times of La Terezza, a bar/coffee shop recommended to us for its view of the city, and so we ended up going there at 8:10. Though the restaurant supposedly closed at 8:30, they wouldn't allow us inside as they had already seemed to close shop. Disappointed, we ended up heading back to the hotel exhausted after a lot of walking for the day.
