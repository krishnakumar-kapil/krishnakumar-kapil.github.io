## Day 0 (May 21, 2018)

We left Austin on the 21st at an ungodly hour in the morning since our flight to JFK and then Rome was at 9 in the morning. Since my parents had prior work in the country and I was moving out of my Austin apartment, we had a large amount of luggage that made the trip quite interesting later on. 

At the airport, Appa started getting stressed out because the flight started getting delayed more and more while we had a connecting flight to catch. The issue was that my parent's flight was on a different PNR than the one going to JFK. This means that in the scenario of a delay, the airlines would not help them with a different flight or alternative routes. 

Luckily, our flight managed to save some time on arrival and arrived slightly early taking a beautiful route around the Atlantic taking a scenic U-turn before turning back. Once we arrived in JFK, Appa and Amma had to pick up their bags and go to a different terminal, while I stayed back in Terminal 3. I scrounged for any possible food options, finally picking a place with ready-made pizza. Ironic, considering how many times we would have pizza in the next few days. 

On the flight to Rome, I managed to sleep a decent amount (which is quite unusual).

## Day 1

I arrived separately from my parents in Rome at 6:30 in the morning. While I had to take a short train ride to get to the main terminal to collect my bags and go through immigration, my parents didn't have any of these difficulties. When we have traveled in the past to a different country, we usually try to get at least one sim card of the local country such that we have local data and access to a local phone number. However, the airport didn't have these services until after exiting the main section which meant I had to wait while my parents arrived at 9:30 to get these sims. We managed to get 2 sim cards with 8 gb of data with Vodafone at €55, which seemed an okay price to pay. We luckily didn't have any data or connection related issues throughout our trip, though we did have offline google maps that ended up being a lifesaver.

Another concern we had was transport from Rome Fiumicino airport to the Hotel in the center of Rome that was an hour away. While Uber existed, it was enormously expensive costing around €85 for a basic car. With 3 large suitcases, this wasn't feasible. Public transport to the center was also turning out to be expensive with the train costing €14 per person while taxis costed €48 (though we didn't know they had a fixed rate before). A smart private shuttle operator managed to catch us in time while we were sorting out the sim card situation.

### Hotel Centro

We arrived at our hotel around 11 am and were greeted by an extremely stern-faced Italian gentleman, who I believe never smiled during the whole time we interacted with him. This kicked off a consistent pattern among all locals that we encountered where it was rare to find anyone who smiled or greeted a tourist happily as in the US or other countries. It seemed as if the concept of the guest being the highest priority wasn't present, which was sad to notice. The hotel was located in an alleyway off the main road in an old but decently kept building. However, their wifi situation was terrible and I don't think we were able to ever connect multiple devices to the network at any one time. We also noticed that there seemed to be a staffing issue in most hotels, where a single person would be responsible for multiple things like housekeeping, breakfast, and general issues.

With a lot planned for the day, we set off to lunch at [Sapori e Delizie Roma](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sapori+e+Delizie+Roma/@41.896327,12.4945214,16z/data=!4m16!1m8!3m7!1s0x132f61af5a97eb77:0xeb5107cdce01d746!2sHotel+Centro!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.9009077!4d12.4949035!3m6!1s0x0:0x9a5441d58f7d0637!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.8948982!4d12.4989921) for a delicious lunch that started the pizza thrill-ride that we had begun. With 3 vegetarians and none of us particularly interested in alcohol, some said our options in Italy would be limited. Yet, we managed to find amazing food and had an amazing food experience through our 10 days in Italy. Italian food doesn't necessarily put a lot of vegetables in their dishes, instead relying on minimal items but uncompromising on the quality of the items. We also noticed a trend towards favoring eggplant in their vegetarian dishes, something which was surprising to us. 


As a foodie family, with 2 members stating that they have sweet teeth (I don't think Appa does :P), we also started our gelato craze that day. Whatever gelato we had in the past, completely paled in imitation to the ones that we had in Italy. The sheer amount of flavors and the texture cannot be exalted upon more. From *bacchio* (hazelnut and chocolate) to delicious mango, we were able to experience a wide variety of flavors throughout the trip. This journey started at [Gelateria da Costanza](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gelateria+da+Costanza/@41.8900177,12.4944463,17z/data=!4m16!1m8!3m7!1s0x132f61af5a97eb77:0xeb5107cdce01d746!2sHotel+Centro!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.9009077!4d12.4949035!3m6!1s0x0:0x63c75e6b12a16ce4!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.8897708!4d12.4951713). The prices were quite reasonable for gelato overall with 2 flavors (the default) falling around €2 or €2.50. Another quirk we noticed was that instead of using a decimal to denote cents, the Italians would use a comma.

### Colosseum

<div class="item left">
    <img data-src="{{'assets/images/blog/italy_trip/day1/arch_of_constantine.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="blog-image">

</div>

We started our sightseeing tour with a guided tour at 2:00 pm with the mighty Colosseum. We were told to wait near the massive Arch of Constantine. After getting a quick nap on the walled edges of the area, we merged with our tour guide. In all the tours, they provided a radio with headphones so that we could hear the guides' voice even if they were further away and in case we got separated. By far one of the best ideas that should be incorporated in all guided tours in my opinion. 


The Colosseum was built to be a combat arena between not only gladiators but with animals and other combat exhibitions. It had 2 main entrances that were along the principal axis of the structure that was used so that the combatants would make a grand entrance. As per my recollection, each entry gate to the building allowed a certain class of Roman citizen that was determined based on a wooden tablet that they would carry with them. These tablets allowed them entry to many of the free public events that were hosted by the nobles and rich citizens.

The Colosseum base used to be filled with sand and the underground passages were used to store the various contraptions used for traps, storing animals, creating passageways, etc. I read about some of this in Mark of Athena that was based in Rome. The Colosseum has lost its outer layer due to a number of earthquakes that have destroyed a large part of the Roman Forum.

### Roman Forum

</div>
**Roman Roads:** The saying "All roads lead to Rome" is a phrase that is thrown about a lot. We got a chance to see some of the most popular roads like the First Roman Road and the 5 km straight road in Pompeii. These roads were traveled on the common Roman chariot, though how they survived with their wooden wheels is a mystery to me. If our current cars can't survive potholes with the extensive improvements in tires and suspension, I truly wonder how bad the rides must have been for the old Romans.

The Italian's and Roman's talent for sculpture on stone might be unparalleled, but they seem to have had a problem with keeping heads on their structures. In the 4 cities we visited, a number of them had heads removed off of them. When we asked locals, they said that it could be burglary to get busts of these figures.

### Start of the Piazzas

    </div>
</div>

After the guided tour of the Colosseum and the Roman Forum, we started walking towards the various famous *Piazzas* in the city like Piazza Venetia. Here we got a chance to view the magnificent [Altare della Patria (Altar of the Fatherland)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Altar+of+the+Fatherland/@41.8933561,12.4819043,16z/data=!4m16!1m8!3m7!1s0x132f61af5a97eb77:0xeb5107cdce01d746!2sHotel+Centro!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.9009077!4d12.4949035!3m6!1s0x132f604d1b805de3:0x21154807a7b83fe1!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.8945977!4d12.4831268), built in honor of Victor Emmanuel (the first king of united Italy). This structure was truly a magnificent sight to witness, with the top of the monument with striking black marble. The building was in striking white in comparison to the reddish tones present in all the other buildings and residential areas of Rome that allowed it to be viewed and recognized from viewpoints all across Rome. 

After Piazza Venetia, we started walking to the Pantheon whilst getting a chance to go through some super tiny streets of Rome. When thinking of Rome prior to coming to the city, this is the kind of narrow pathways I imagined. Another interesting point in the city is that cars are parked with 2 wheels on the sidewalk and 2 wheels on the main road to maximize road space. While India is known for its poor road sense and traffic sense, I have truly never been as scared for my life as I have to cross the roads of Italy.

### Pantheon
<div class="item">

Unfortunately, this was a partial photosphere and thus momento cannot process it properly. Google Photo's does not provide a good way to embed photospheres in websites yet, and the only way to get the viewing would be through Google Maps that is paid :(. If you would like to see the original, please contact me. I have attached a link to the photosphere of a Street View image of the Pantheon.
</div>
[Street View image](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pantheon/@41.8986108,12.4768729,3a,75y,44.42h,113.69t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipNC5QrXLy5L-gQ0Z24vQ_Tw8wlFO51x4prxAeWV!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipNC5QrXLy5L-gQ0Z24vQ_Tw8wlFO51x4prxAeWV%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-30.000002-ya84.44788-ro-0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352!4m5!3m4!1s0x132f604f678640a9:0xcad165fa2036ce2c!8m2!3d41.8986108!4d12.4768729)

I didn't know prior to the trip that there existed a Pantheon in Rome with the outer facade similar to the one present in Greece. With an opening in the roof, the building was spectacularly lit even at 5:00 pm in the evening. The paintings and sculptures had a lot of references to Christianity instead of what I initially expected of the Roman Pantheon or the Greek Pantheon. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome), the Rome Pantheon used to be a temple of the Roman gods but is now a Christian Church. The height of this Pantheon was quite impressive 

Outside the Pantheon, there was a violinist playing famous pop songs like Ed Sheeran's Shape of You next to a fountain.

### Piazza Navona

<div class="item right">
<img data-src="{{'assets/images/blog/italy_trip/day1/piazza_navona_woman.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="blog-image height-limit">
</div>
We then left for Piazza Navona, home of [Sant'Agnes in Agone](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sant'Agnese+in+Agone/@41.8987146,12.4728067,18z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x132f604f678640a9:0xcad165fa2036ce2c!2sPantheon!8m2!3d41.8986108!4d12.4768729!3m4!1s0x0:0x896b94c3332ab951!8m2!3d41.898844!4d12.4725519) and 3 beautiful fountains. With residential buildings surrounding the Piazza with live music being performed, it was a relaxing spot to rest our tired legs and bodies. A standard feature of the Italian home are these wooden shuttered windows that are able to fold in different places to provide more air and light. It also seemed like they could change the direction of the slats from inside. After experiencing poor blinds in Austin and extreme sunlight in the mornings, this system would've been so so nice to have.

</div>

The church of Sant'Agnes in Agone had a beautiful interior of the church with incredible paintings and sculptures. The Italian artist's ability to paint on the ceiling of their churches with such detail was something that I've never appreciated before. This church was also the first where we saw the sheer amount of gold paint or actual gold used to decorate the arches and ceiling.

### Trevi Fountain

<div class="item">
<img data-src="{{'assets/images/blog/italy_trip/day1/trevi_fountain.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="blog-image featured">
</div>

We then walked to the [Trevi Fountain](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trevi+Fountain/@41.901609,12.4816779,16.9z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x132f6053278340d5:0xf676f1e1cc02bbb6!8m2!3d41.9009325!4d12.4833132), that while impressive wasn't as spectacular as expected. It may have been because of the sheer crowd of people around us or the fact that we were tired, but we were more interested in getting food than spending time there haha.

We ended our adventures for the day at [Sora Lucia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sora+Lucia/@41.902107,12.4841697,16.9z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x5ac1f93b8ab50b0d!8m2!3d41.9024018!4d12.4870294). For dinner, we had a cheese platter starter with the complimentary bread as a starter, and for the main course had 3 plates of pasta: pesto, an arrabiata based, and another vegetable one.
