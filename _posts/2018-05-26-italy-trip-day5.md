After an early breakfast at Hotel Ibis Styles Garibaldi, we lugged the luggage (haha) to the train station for our train at 8:00 am. The train ride to Florence through the Tuscan countryside was incredibly scenic. We arrived in Florence around 11 am and took a taxi to [Hotel Leopaldo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hotel+Leopolda/@43.7806092,11.2348884,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m7!3m6!1s0x132a56ba4863ba8f:0x7c2eabc981fcd3e8!5m1!1s2018-06-10!8m2!3d43.7806092!4d11.2370771) after rolling around the luggage a bit more.

Hotel Leopolda is an incredibly old hotel which we hypothesize was converted to a hotel from a home. Since we had arrived before the check-in time, we couldn't get access to our room and had to leave our baggage before leaving immediately. 4 days in and my mom was already craving anything other than Italian food. We went to [Ristorante Goong](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ristorante+Goong/@43.7806092,11.2348884,17z/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x132a56ac2882e817:0x183d3ae6ce6ee184!5m1!1s2018-06-10!8m2!3d43.7728343!4d11.2452828) for some Korean food. The portions were quite disappointing despite the cost, but we needed a bathroom haha and they had a clean one. After some sushi, soup, and rice, we headed to the famous [Uffizi Gallery](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Uffizi+Gallery/@43.7677856,11.2531221,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x132a540087230dbb:0xff95595eb045fc7b!4m5!3m4!1s0x132a54008dc59081:0xcddeb7c89bf0c4cd!8m2!3d43.7677856!4d11.2553108).

Unlike some of the other cities, we hadn't bought tickets to anything in Florence. Due to this, the previous night a freak-out session ensued where I frantically tried to find out what we could do with and without tickets. There are 3 main art and sculpture galleries in Florence: The Uffizi, [Accademia di Florence](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Academy+Of+Florence+Art+Gallery/@43.776838,11.2565422,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x132a5406a8d7312d:0x33d323549615b936!2sAccademia+Gallery!8m2!3d43.776838!4d11.2587309!3m4!1s0x132a541b5298099d:0x913850ffe35c42ed!8m2!3d43.7768169!4d11.2587152) and [Pitti Palace](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pitti+Palace/@43.7651533,11.2478194,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x132a515441db99f1:0x5cd0cce4e6f1502a!8m2!3d43.7651533!4d11.2500081). We could get a combined skip-the-line ticket for the Uffizi, Pitti Palace and the [Boboli Gardens](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Boboli+Gardens/@43.7624972,11.2462109,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x132a515690734e97:0x40c02f73b03d9b2!8m2!3d43.7624972!4d11.2483996) (that supposedly worked for 3 days) and so we jumped on it. But, because of the rush, we didn't realize that each of the other Duomos/Cathedrals/Basilicas/Churches needed tickets. In hindsight, it might have been worth to buy the [Firenze Card](http://www.firenzecard.it/index.php?lang=en) that would have allowed us entry into each of these.

            Anyway, back to us walking along the Arno River that splits Florence. While the Arno itself was a disappointment due to how green the water was, the buildings along the river gave Florence it's unique feel. Each of the buildings had yellow and reddish paints and were small 3 story buildings with the traditional Italian windows and wooden blinds. On the famous bridge <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ponte+Vecchio/@43.767925,11.2509548,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x132a56aaa2dcb667:0x40310ae830e702e8!8m2!3d43.767925!4d11.2531435">Ponte Vecchio</a>, you can see houses actually built on the bridge. While I'm sure it's safe, I just wouldn't trust the science behind the ancient bridges.

        <p>After quite the walk, we ended up at the Gallery trying to figure out and hoping that the ticket we bought would work. The ticket also had an associated specific time to it, but luckily we had made it in the time period and could claim the ticket from our online voucher. Even with a skip-the-line, we took a non-trivial amount of time to enter the gallery.</p>
        <br><p>After never hearing or encountering of Madonna and Child, it was quite jarring seeing an overwhelming deluge of them in the gallery. Oh, and seeing a large number of naked sculptures with the parents haha. Another consistent theme present in the paintings were the gold embossed Christian imagery in a 3 paneled painting.</p>

## Dinner

    <div class="9u 12u$(mobile) item">
        <p>We got out of the Uffizi Gallery a whopping 4 hours at 6 pm. Decently hungry, we headed over to a place my dad had found across the river called Cuculia Ristorante Liberia. But, by the time we got there they were holding a cooking class and told us to come at 7:30 pm. With an hour to kill, we were desperately trying to just find someplace to sit down and relax our weary legs after a long day of walking. We tried going to the river, but there weren't any seating areas there either. It was just a ledge by the side of the road. In the end, we ended up going to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Piazza+Santo+Spirito,+50125+Firenze+FI,+Italy/@43.767925,11.2509548,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x132a51548f854a1d:0xeb33a9db9013b02f!8m2!3d43.7666376!4d11.2475085">Santo Spirito</a> and just sitting on the church steps because hilariously the church was closed for prayer and our luck was terrible.</p>
        <p>I had a moment of observation whilst sitting. Florence has these unique extensions in their buildings where the base of the building will be of lesser area than the top. To balance the protrusions from the building they build arch-like structures that allow them to extend the floor surface area. Ideally, I'd like to go and observe this from the inside as well, but it seemed structurally sound since it was so prevalent. </p>

We then headed over to [Cuculia Ristorante Liberia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cuculia+Ristorante+Libreria/@43.7682233,11.2438953,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x132a56acabe24ba1:0x56644263a88c6f9!8m2!3d43.7682233!4d11.24608://www.google.com/maps/place/Cuculia+Ristorante+Libreria/@43.7682233,11.2438953,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x132a56acabe24ba1:0x56644263a88c6f9!8m2!3d43.7682233!4d11.246084) for dinner. Cuculia was a pure vegetarian and organic restaurant, much to my parents' relief. Served by an extra talkative young gentleman who tried to sell us on wine and every dish in the menu, we abnormally ordered a beetroot fried ball starter followed by ravioli and another pasta dish whose name is escaping me. However, the star of the show for me was the chili olive oil that he brought out with the complimentary bread. Italian food up till this point had a lack of spice in the food. As someone who enjoys a fair amount of spice, by this point I was craving some spicy food. We were extremely happy with the quality of the food (quantity could be more for the price, but understandable) and ordered a tiramisu to close off our meal.

After the dinner, we headed back to the hotel walking along the river. After not observing the whole day, we observed that the clouds had this amazing look to them as if they had been drawn or painted on the sky. They had this incredible sharp 3D look that I haven't seen in other cities or countries. This one fact made my day in Florence. The sunset along the riverside was an amazing sight to witness as you can see from the images. We ended off the day going back to the hotel and then going on a laundry adventure to be bitten by mosquitos in the Florentine swelter. Our hotel didn't have any A/C in the room and so we had to survive with the windows open, which meant being bitten by the good old mosquitos. It's a miracle we managed to get any sleep.
