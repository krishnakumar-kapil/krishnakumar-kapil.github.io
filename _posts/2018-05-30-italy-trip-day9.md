With our train ride back to Rome at 11 am, we didn't do anything in the last hours of our stay in Milan. We got some groceries so we could have lunch on the train going back, and then left for the station lugging the broken-wheeled suitcases to the station.

Though we slept quite well the previous night, the 3 of us all slept a lot on the 3 hour journey to Rome. We were planning to store our luggage near Roma Termini, the main train station of Rome, while we went to the Appian way and the Roman Catacombs. However, this plan broke down when we found that the luggage places that we found were quite expensive for the size of our luggage and that the Roman Catacombs were closed on Wednesdays. 

Instead, we quickly had whatever food we had packed and left for our hotel in Fiumcino, an hours journey from Rome in a taxi. Figuring out transport was also a bit of an annoyance as Uber's were too expensive, the train only went to the airport, and we didn't have a private shuttle's phone number. We figured out that the taxi would be the cheapest to go to the hotel, though we were worried about the excess rates for the journey from the airport to the hotel (there was a fixed rate to the airport).

We arrived at Euros Inn Hotel to be pleasantly surprised at the care of the front desk representative and the quality of our room. Thankfully, the hotel had great wifi which led to an hour break where my dad had his much-needed afternoon nap (what an old man).

Refreshed and looking forward to watching the sunset at [Pontile Di Ostia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Galleria+Vittorio+Emanuele+II/@45.4862671,9.2016725,16z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x4786c3f8853adc1d:0x192dc3c5f4975b72!2sPorta+Nuova!8m2!3d45.4798874!4d9.1925959!3m4!1s0x0:0x270b9ca95809d416!8m2!3d45.4658431!4d9.1899401) by the sea, we headed out from our hotel. The walk started on an ominous note since the bridge that we were crossing didn't have a well defined walking path and we had to wade through the bushes. The rest of the road didn't have a footpath either and we were walking on the edge of the road on what seemed to be a countryside road. We ended up going to the riverside where a kind gentleman allowed us to walk on the dock where all the boats were kept down the river. We eventually exited the riverside, and started heading towards the center of Ostia, the small coast-side city.

It was close to an hour before we arrived at the beach of Ostia. We've seen white sand beaches and black sand beaches, but the beach at Ostia was a grey sheen. As the parents were quite hungry, we didn't spend much time on the beach and instead went to [La Friggatoria]() for some burgers. The food was okay with the quantities quite small for the price. We then started our dangerous journey back to the hotel.

The road back was initially okay as we were walking along the main road and it had a footpath. We also got to see more amazing views of the sunset amidst the trees. But, the road to go back was basically a highway. Google Maps literally suggested that we walk back on a highway without a footpath. It was incredibly scary to walk on the side of the road with fast traffic rushing at you. Since the road curved here and there, we also crossed the road so that cars didn't actually hit us and we were visible. To only add to our concern, a police car also appeared though it wasn't for us, but we were sure that all the drivers were looking at us and thinking "crazy people!". Thoroughly rattled, we managed to reach the bridge and then the hotel safely.

## Day 10

My parents left in the wee hours of the morning for the airport for their flight at 6 am. I, meanwhile, smartly chose a flight later on at 11:15 am and so got to eat breakfast and sleep in. I took the shuttle to the airport where I managed to check in and board the Etihad flight with no issues. After 6 hours of sleeping, reading and watching movies, I landed in Abu Dhabi airport where I had to kill a bit more time. My gate was on the complete opposite end of the airport so it ended up being a decent walk. The flight to Mumbai also got delayed by half an hour after we had boarded the flight, and by the time they brought out the food I was ravenous.

I landed in Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport at around 3:30 am, though by the time I got out of the massive immigration line it was close to 4. While the rest of the airport is absolutely amazing, the customs lines are extremely poorly designed at the airport. On this occasion, the line literally wrapped around the baggage collection areas.

On the road back to Pune, the Ghat area of the Mumbai-Pune expressway was completely clogged up with slow-moving trucks that extended our journey to 4 hours instead of 3. A sad conclusion to what was an unforgettable trip through Italy!
