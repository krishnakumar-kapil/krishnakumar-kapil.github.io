## Day 0 (May 21, 2018)

We left Austin on the 21st at an ungodly hour in the morning since our flight to JFK and then Rome was at 9 in the morning. Since my parents had prior work in the country and I was moving out of my Austin apartment, we had a large amount of luggage that made the trip quite interesting later on. 

At the airport, Appa started getting stressed out because the flight started getting delayed more and more while we had a connecting flight to catch. The issue was that my parent's flight was on a different PNR than the one going to JFK. This means that in the scenario of a delay, the airlines would not help them with a different flight or alternative routes. 

Luckily, our flight managed to save some time on arrival and arrived slightly early taking a beautiful route around the Atlantic taking a scenic U-turn before turning back. Once we arrived in JFK, Appa and Amma had to pick up their bags and go to a different terminal, while I stayed back in Terminal 3. I scrounged for any possible food options, finally picking a place with ready-made pizza. Ironic, considering how many times we would have pizza in the next few days. 

On the flight to Rome, I managed to sleep a decent amount (which is quite unusual).

## Day 1

<div class="tripblan">
<iframe width="800px" height="500px" src="https://tripblan.com/map/italy-trip?maplines=true&day=1&color=0094ff&markercolor=0094ff" style="border: #dddddf 1px solid;  border-radius: 3px;"></iframe>
</div>

I arrived separately from my parents in Rome at 6:30 in the morning. While I had to take a short train ride to get to the main terminal to collect my bags and go through immigration, my parents didn't have any of these difficulties. When we have traveled in the past to a different country, we usually try to get at least one sim card of the local country such that we have local data and access to a local phone number. However, the airport didn't have these services until after exiting the main section which meant I had to wait while my parents arrived at 9:30 to get these sims. We managed to get 2 sim cards with 8 gb of data with Vodafone at €55, which seemed an okay price to pay. We luckily didn't have any data or connection related issues throughout our trip, though we did have offline google maps that ended up being a lifesaver.

Another concern we had was transport from Rome Fiumicino airport to the Hotel in the center of Rome that was an hour away. While Uber existed, it was incredibly expensive costing around €85 for a basic car. With 3 large suitcases, this wasn't feasible. Public transport to the center was also turning out to be expensive with the train costing €14 per person while taxis costed €48 (though we didn't know they had a fixed rate before). A smart private shuttle operator managed to catch us in time while we were sorting out the sim card situation.

### Hotel Centro

We arrived at our hotel around 11 am and were greeted by an extremely stern-faced Italian gentleman, who I believe never smiled during the whole time we interacted with him. This kicked off a consistent pattern among all locals that we encountered where it was rare to find anyone who smiled or greeted a tourist happily as in the US or other countries. It seemed as if the concept of the guest being the highest priority wasn't present, which was sad to notice. The hotel was located in an alleyway off the main road in an old but decently kept building. However, their wifi situation was terrible and I don't think we were able to ever connect multiple devices to the network at any one time. We also noticed that there seemed to be a staffing issue in most hotels, where a single person would be responsible for multiple things like housekeeping, breakfast, and general issues.

With a lot planned for the day, we set off to lunch at [Sapori e Delizie Roma](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sapori+e+Delizie+Roma/@41.896327,12.4945214,16z/data=!4m16!1m8!3m7!1s0x132f61af5a97eb77:0xeb5107cdce01d746!2sHotel+Centro!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.9009077!4d12.4949035!3m6!1s0x0:0x9a5441d58f7d0637!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.8948982!4d12.4989921) for a delicious lunch that started the pizza thrill-ride that we had begun. With 3 vegetarians and none of us particularly interested in alcohol, some said our options in Italy would be limited. Yet, we managed to find amazing food and had an incredible food experience through our 10 days in Italy. Italian food doesn't necessarily put a lot of vegetables in their dishes, instead relying on minimal items but uncompromising on the quality of the items. We also noticed a trend towards favoring eggplant in their vegetarian dishes, something which was surprising to us. 


As a foodie family, with 2 members stating that they have sweet teeth (I don't think Appa does :P), we also started our gelato craze that day. Whatever gelato we had in the past, completely paled in imitation to the ones that we had in Italy. The sheer amount of flavors and the texture cannot be exalted upon more. From *bacchio* (hazelnut and chocolate) to delicious mango, we were able to experience a wide variety of flavors throughout the trip. This journey started at [Gelateria da Costanza](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gelateria+da+Costanza/@41.8900177,12.4944463,17z/data=!4m16!1m8!3m7!1s0x132f61af5a97eb77:0xeb5107cdce01d746!2sHotel+Centro!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.9009077!4d12.4949035!3m6!1s0x0:0x63c75e6b12a16ce4!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.8897708!4d12.4951713). The prices were quite reasonable for gelato overall with 2 flavors (the default) falling around €2 or €2.50. Another quirk we noticed was that instead of using a decimal to denote cents, the Italians would use a comma.

### Colosseum

<div class="item left">
    <img src="{{'assets/images/blog/italy_trip/day1/arch_of_constantine.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="blog-image">
    <figcaption>Arch of Constantine</figcaption>
</div>

We started our sightseeing tour with a guided tour at 2:00 pm with the mighty Colosseum. We were told to wait near the massive Arch of Constantine. After getting a quick nap on the walled edges of the area, we merged with our tour guide. In all the tours, they provided a radio with headphones so that we could hear the guides' voice even if they were further away and in case we got separated. By far one of the best ideas that should be incorporated in all guided tours in my opinion. 


The Colosseum was built to be a combat arena between not only gladiators but with animals and other combat exhibitions. It had 2 main entrances that were along the principal axis of the structure that was used so that the combatants would make a grand entrance. As per my recollection, each entry gate to the building allowed a certain class of Roman citizen that was determined based on a wooden tablet that they would carry with them. These tablets allowed them entry to many of the free public events that were hosted by the nobles and rich citizens.

The Colosseum base used to be filled with sand and the underground passages were used to store the various contraptions used for traps, storing animals, creating passageways, etc. I read about some of this in Mark of Athena that was based in Rome. The Colosseum has lost its outer layer due to a number of earthquakes that have destroyed a large part of the Roman Forum.

### Roman Forum

</div>
**Roman Roads:** The saying "All roads lead to Rome" is a phrase that is thrown about a lot. We got a chance to see some of the most popular roads like the First Roman Road and the 5 km straight road in Pompeii. These roads were traveled on the common Roman chariot, though how they survived with their wooden wheels is a mystery to me. If our current cars can't survive potholes with the extensive improvements in tires and suspension, I truly wonder how bad the rides must have been for the old Romans.

The Italian's and Roman's talent for sculpture on stone might be unparalleled, but they seem to have had a problem with keeping heads on their structures. In the 4 cities we visited, a number of them had heads removed off of them. When we asked locals, they said that it could be burglary to get busts of these figures.

### Start of the Piazzas

    </div>
</div>

After the guided tour of the Colosseum and the Roman Forum, we started walking towards the various famous *Piazzas* in the city like Piazza Venetia. Here we got a chance to view the magnificent [Altare della Patria (Altar of the Fatherland)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Altar+of+the+Fatherland/@41.8933561,12.4819043,16z/data=!4m16!1m8!3m7!1s0x132f61af5a97eb77:0xeb5107cdce01d746!2sHotel+Centro!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.9009077!4d12.4949035!3m6!1s0x132f604d1b805de3:0x21154807a7b83fe1!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.8945977!4d12.4831268), built in honor of Victor Emmanuel (the first king of united Italy). This structure was truly a magnificent sight to witness, with the top of the monument with striking black marble. The building was in striking white in comparison to the reddish tones present in all the other buildings and residential areas of Rome that allowed it to be viewed and recognized from viewpoints all across Rome. 

After Piazza Venetia, we started walking to the Pantheon whilst getting a chance to go through some super tiny streets of Rome. When thinking of Rome prior to coming to the city, this is the kind of narrow pathways I imagined. Another interesting point in the city is that cars are parked with 2 wheels on the sidewalk and 2 wheels on the main road to maximize road space. While India is known for its poor road sense and traffic sense, I have truly never been as scared for my life as I have to cross the roads of Italy.

### Pantheon
<div class="item">

Unfortunately, this was a partial photosphere and thus momento cannot process it properly.

If you would like to see the original, please contact me. I have attached a link to the photosphere of a Street View image of the Pantheon.
</div>
[Street View image](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pantheon/@41.8986108,12.4768729,3a,75y,44.42h,113.69t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipNC5QrXLy5L-gQ0Z24vQ_Tw8wlFO51x4prxAeWV!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipNC5QrXLy5L-gQ0Z24vQ_Tw8wlFO51x4prxAeWV%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-30.000002-ya84.44788-ro-0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352!4m5!3m4!1s0x132f604f678640a9:0xcad165fa2036ce2c!8m2!3d41.8986108!4d12.4768729)

I didn't know prior to the trip that there existed a Pantheon in Rome with the outer facade similar to the one present in Greece. With an opening in the roof, the building was spectacularly lit even at 5:00 pm in the evening. The paintings and sculptures had a lot of references to Christianity instead of what I initially expected of the Roman Pantheon or the Greek Pantheon. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome), the Rome Pantheon used to be a temple of the Roman gods but is now a Christian Church. The height of this Pantheon was quite impressive 

Outside the Pantheon, there was a violinist playing famous pop songs like Ed Sheeran's Shape of You next to a fountain.

### Piazza Navona

<div class="item right">
<img src="{{'assets/images/blog/italy_trip/day1/piazza_navona_woman.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="blog-image height-limit">
</div>
We then left for Piazza Navona, home of [Sant'Agnes in Agone](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sant'Agnese+in+Agone/@41.8987146,12.4728067,18z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x132f604f678640a9:0xcad165fa2036ce2c!2sPantheon!8m2!3d41.8986108!4d12.4768729!3m4!1s0x0:0x896b94c3332ab951!8m2!3d41.898844!4d12.4725519) and 3 beautiful fountains. With residential buildings surrounding the Piazza with live music being performed, it was a relaxing spot to rest our tired legs and bodies. A standard feature of the Italian home are these wooden shuttered windows that are able to fold in different places to provide more air and light. It also seemed like they could change the direction of the slats from inside. After experiencing poor blinds in Austin and extreme sunlight in the mornings, this system would've been so so nice to have.

</div>

The church of Sant'Agnes in Agone had a beautiful interior of the church with incredible paintings and sculptures. The Italian artist's ability to paint on the ceiling of their churches with such detail was something that I've never appreciated before. This church was also the first where we saw the sheer amount of gold paint or actual gold used to decorate the arches and ceiling.

### Trevi Fountain

<div class="item">
<img src="{{'assets/images/blog/italy_trip/day1/trevi_fountain.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="blog-image featured">
</div>

We then walked to the [Trevi Fountain](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trevi+Fountain/@41.901609,12.4816779,16.9z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x132f6053278340d5:0xf676f1e1cc02bbb6!8m2!3d41.9009325!4d12.4833132), that while impressive wasn't as spectacular as expected. It may have been because of the sheer crowd of people around us or the fact that we were tired, but we were more interested in getting food than spending time there haha.

We ended our adventures for the day at [Sora Lucia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sora+Lucia/@41.902107,12.4841697,16.9z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x5ac1f93b8ab50b0d!8m2!3d41.9024018!4d12.4870294). For dinner, we had a cheese platter starter with the complimentary bread as a starter, and for the main course had 3 plates of pasta: pesto, an arrabiata based, and another vegetable one.

# Day 2

We had started off the day at Hotel Centro. While my parents wake up really early (6:00 am) on holidays, this day was special where we all slept in till 9 am. After that just getting ready and having breakfast brought us to 11 am. The breakfast in Italy generally was a boatload of sweet items like croissants and baked goods with some untoasted bread. We were lucky that every hotel had cereal, fruits and thankfully yoghurt :O.

We started our tourism for the day by going to see [Basilica Papale di Santa Maria Maggiore](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Basilica+Papale+di+Santa+Maria+Maggiore/@41.8980089,12.4972263,18z/data=!4m16!1m8!3m7!1s0x132f61af5a97eb77:0xeb5107cdce01d746!2sHotel+Centro!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.9009077!4d12.4949035!3m6!1s0x132f61a4db7d30d7:0xf7b354fb8f8c357a!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.897599!4d12.498408) from the outside.

### Spanish Steps

    <figcaption>Spanish Steps</figcaption>
</div>


The [Spanish Steps](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spanish_Steps) are an extremely popular site for tourists to go to. They are extremely crowded and are basically impossible to get a clean shot of in daytime. While my mom was raving about having to see the steps during the last 2 days, it turned out quite the disappointment from the bottom. The steps were just ordinary marble without decoration. I think I was more impressed by the [Grandview Park in SF](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grandview+Park/@37.7564084,-122.4739283,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808587602e7a2d15:0x6957dbab1942eef7!8m2!3d37.7564084!4d-122.4717396). The grouping of the steps were in 12 pairs. With only 135 steps, this wasn't even close to some of the other structures we visited in Italy.

However, we did get our first view over the whole of Rome at the top of the Spanish Steps. At the top, there is a church where we couldn't take pictures unfortunately. As usual, Appa was 'soaking' in the paintings inside while Amma and I were getting restless to see other places before we had to leave for our Vatican tour.

As the navigator throughout the trip, I started guiding the family towards the Borghese gardens. On the way, we got to see even better Vista Points of Rome. The gardens themselves were lush with greenery. Instead of the trimmed top heavy trees seen throughout Italy, the gardens had trees that we were more familiar with.

</div>

After the Borghese Gardens we started heading west towards the Vatican. Along the way we got lunch at a small cafe called [Mondo Arancina](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mondo+Arancina/@41.9118113,12.4745687,17z/data=!4m16!1m8!3m7!1s0x132f61af5a97eb77:0xeb5107cdce01d746!2sHotel+Centro!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.9009077!4d12.4949035!3m6!1s0x0:0x48b559442fe000c4!5m1!1s2018-06-08!8m2!3d41.912934!4d12.4755717) that was truly bustling. We managed to get a great deal for a pizza, a fried rice ball, and a dessert called [Cannoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannoli).


After lunch, we got a chance to visit the [Piazza del Popolo](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Piazza_del_Popolo). With two churches on either side of the main obelisk in an extremely wide area, it was an incredible 360 view. After the piazza, we crossed the famous [River Tiber](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tiber) which is known to be the birthplace of Rome by the twin brothers Romulus and Remus. Our first time on the west side of the Tiber River, we managed to walk on a road just filled with expensive fashion shops. One of the names was extremely funny :P.

### Bathrooms and Water

Before we arrived at our destination, the ever concerning toilet break had to be taken by Appa who quickly went to a McDonald's 5 minutes away while my mother tension's rose and rose. The lack of public toilets in Italy ended up being quite a frustration throughout the trip since basic malls, shops, and train stations just didn't have these facilities. 

Another source of frustration was the lack of free drinking water in the nation. Hotels and restaurants just didn't provide water and expected the customers to pay for bottled water. Even if we brought our own bottled water, in certain places they made us pay for their bottled water. 

### Vatican Museum

We started the tour by heading to the Vatican Museum that had a huge line outside. Luckily, we had got the Skip-the-line-Tickets that allowed us to go with an official tour guide and as the name suggests: skip the line. With the skip-the-line tickets we also had the advantage of not having to bring our passports for ID verification (dad made the right call to not bring them much to my chagrin).

Our tour guide initially brought us to a foyer with this pine-cone structure and the metallic earth structure. The museum was one long corridor that culminated in the Sistine Chapel. Along the corridor, most of the ceilings were painted in a fashion to give a 3-d look to the paintings that was extremely realistic. I ended up looking at each ceiling that looked 3-d in the future to check if it was actually sculpted or painted.

My favorite room has to be the map room. Along the walls, incredibly detailed topography maps of the parts of Italy were hand painted. The ceiling was an amalgamation of beautiful paintings with the framing all done in gold to give an opulent and indulgent feel to the room

Our trip got slightly delayed because a couple, who funnily thought Appa was a television anchor from Minnesota, got separated during the mad chaos of the crowd. The group has to follow the tour guide's flag that they carry in their hands. 
<div class="personal">
    However, our tour guide didn't hold it high enough haha and Amma suggested holding it higher upon which the tour guide happily handed it to Appa to hold. I got roped in when the tour guide had to go get the official tickets for the Vatican. Unfortunately, we were unpaid in our meaningful contributions.

### [Sistine Chapel](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sistine_Chapel)

Unfortunately, it is prohibited to take pictures in the Chapel itself. The Chapel is a magnificent piece of art with each wall and the ceiling painted in masterpieces with the dominant color being blue of the sky. Each group gets such little time to look at the various paintings. Michelangelo's famous [The Last Judgement]("https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Last_Judgment_(Michelangelo)") adorns the altar wall of the Chapel.

### [St. Peter's Basilica](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/St._Peter%27s_Basilica)

<div class="item right">
    <img src="{{ 'assets/images/blog/italy_trip/day2/basilica_ceiling.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="blog-image">
    <figcaption>Basilica Ceiling</figcaption>
</div>

The longest catholic church in the world. Though you can't tell when you visit, the Basilica is actually in the form of a crucifix. It is a really incredible site with an incredibly long lead-up to the main dome. The main corridor has an arch ceiling with these consistent rectangular patterns that managed to expose the height and size of the Basilica. Unlike other Basilicas that have circular pillars, St. Peter's Basilica has rectangular pillars with engravings of what seemed to be griffins at the top of them. In addition, these pillars are present in the foyer of the basilica. The main corridor of the basilica also has a list of the largest churches in the world on it's floor. Naturally, St. Peter's Basilica is the largest.

    <img src="{{ 'assets/images/blog/italy_trip/day2/pieta.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="blog-image">
    <figcaption>Michelangelo's Pieta</figcaption>
</div>

Even the side corridors are substantially more impressive and decorated than normal. One of them has a Chapel where weddings could be held if and only if you have connections with the Pope or the cardinals. Another famous sculpture present in these halls is Michelangelo's [Pieta]("https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Piet%C3%A0_(Michelangelo)").

The main dome of the Basilica was designed by Michelangelo. The altar is a reference to the confession of faith by St. Peter, that led to his martyrdom. Each of the letters around the dome are 1.4 feet tall that spell out 
*TV ES PETRVS ET SVPER HANC PETRAM AEDIFICABO ECCLESIAM MEAM. TIBI DABO CLAVES REGNI CAELORVM*
(... you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church. ... I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ... Vulgate, Matthew 16:18–19.)*

The Pope stays in a palace on the right of the basilica (when facing the basilica), where he is protected by the [Pontifical Swiss Guard](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pontifical_Swiss_Guard). The Pope makes appearances on Wednesday and Sunday in the morning. We weren't particularly interested in seeing the Pope and so by chance we managed to pick a day that should have attracted lesser crowd in the evening since most people would have gone in the morning to see the Pope.

After taking in the sites of the Vatican, our tour guide naturally dropped us off at the pervasive souvenir shop, where we naturally bought nothing and used the thankfully free bathrooms (Yes Kapil, it was quite a challenge finding them). We then headed back towards the River Tiber, getting a chance to see the [Caste Sant'Angelo](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Castel_Sant%27Angelo).

We walked down to the river side to see it was just as dirty from above as it was upclose. The greenish tinge was present in other rivers that we saw in Italy, though the sea itself was quite clear as seen on the Amalfi Coast. On the Vatican Side of the river, we got to also see the magnificent [Supreme Court of Italy]("https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Supreme_Court_of_Cassation_(Italy)").

#### Busses and Cigarettes
After walking this long, we really wanted to just bus to the other side of the city to see the Baths of Caracella and the Circus Massimo. To use the bus in Italy, you have to already have a bus ticket prior to when you board the bus. The most convenient place to buy a bus ticket was a tobacco store.

The sheer usage of cigarettes and tobacco in Italy blew our minds. While Italy is the 34th in the world for [per capita tobacco usage](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_countries_by_cigarette_consumption_per_capita), we had never heard of this until arriving in the country. It was truly impossible for me to walk around on the city streets without someone or the other smoking a cigarette. It seems to be a big problem in the country as people would start getting their cigarettes and lighters out as the A/C train (where you can't smoke) slowed down for a station. Unlike most airports, Italy is one of the few remaining that still has a dedicated smoking box, that was extremely crowded.

Anyway, the system is that you buy the bus tickets and then get them authenticated on the bus on a ticket machine. The tickets would work for 100 minutes (I have no clue how they came with that value) after the point of authentication for that day.

---
The [Circus Massimo](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Circus_Maximus) ended up being quite disappointing. It was just an empty sand field with a nice backdrop of the Roman Forum. There was a nice botanical garden next to the field which my mom wanted to go see. We went to see the Baths of Caracello but they were closed by the time we went there :(, and there wasn't much to see outside of them.

### Dinner

We had our dinner at [Trettoria Cecio](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trattoria+Cecio/@41.8983958,12.4990176,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x132f61a37e0230b7:0x95d46bed75a733b3!8m2!3d41.8983958!4d12.501206://www.google.com/maps/place/Trattoria+Cecio/@41.8983958,12.4990176,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x132f61a37e0230b7:0x95d46bed75a733b3!8m2!3d41.8983958!4d12.5012063) where we had some pasta again after a long wait to sit with people smoking next to us. It was some really good food, but I think after the amount we had walked that day anything would have been good. A note to all travellers to Italy, if you want to go to some of the better restaurants do not expect to be seated if you don't have a reservation. These reservations had to be atleast a day in advance for dinner. It happened so many times where I'd find a nice restaurant, call them only to find out that they wouldn't take us for that day. Since our timing tended to be variable, it wasn't possible for us to eat at some of the highest rated places during our trip. However, I do think we found some incredible places.

After dinner, my parents their dose of daily gelato and we all headed back to another day of questionable wifi at Hotel Centro.
