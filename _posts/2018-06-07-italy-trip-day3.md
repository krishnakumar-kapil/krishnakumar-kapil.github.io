We start off day 3 with the classic early morning start, since we must catch our train from [Roma Termini](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Roma+Termini/@41.9010032,12.499715,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x132f61a439c0ffef:0xa4307dbef261a994!8m2!3d41.9010032!4d12.5019037) at 9:00 am. Though we were only 10 minutes away from the station, with 3 large suitcases and a bag whose wheels didn't work -.- we had to take a taxi to the station. As usual, we had to pay a surcharge for our bags. Italy also has a city tax rule where hotels can basically charge you up to 4 euros per person per night for staying. Annoyingly, this charge is always collected in person at the hotel, which means you still end up paying out of cash or card regardless of your prior bookings.

We reached the train station without incident, though I was falling asleep in the car. After trying to lug our bags through the cigarette smoke, we went through an abysmal security check only to realize our train was delayed by 35 minutes. Once it actually left the station, we were so amazed at how quiet and comfortable the entire journey was. Usually my dad always stays up and just stares for days outside the window, but this time all of us just slept on our journey south to Naples.

# Naples

We arrive at the city of Naples in [Garibaldi Station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Garibaldi+Train+Station/@40.8528154,14.2705622,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x133b0817749b7abb:0x30f042236fe7f0f0!8m2!3d40.8528154!4d14.2727509). With our hotel only 2 minutes away and all of us stingy folks unwilling to spend on a taxi, the lugging of the luggage began with yours truly taking 2 suitcases and navigating sweatily. The station opens up to a beautiful large Piazza with an interesting glass based roof that as we later learnt was the entrance to the Napoli Metro station. As our hotels all had a check in time of around 2:00 pm we could not check-in to the hotel, and left our luggage with them taking the horribly colored cyan and orange backpack with us.

## Duomo di Napoli

<duomo_di_napoli>

Napoli is a city of crowded, cramped, streets where you are the prey of the predatory motor vehicles. Looked like home. Our first stop for the day was the [Duomo di Napoli](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Naples_Cathedral). A cathedral with a massive outside wall, we weren't able to fully appreciate the size of it because the entrance was from an extremely tiny street. The church is the home of the Archbishop of Naples and is in recognition of [Saint Janurius](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Saint_Januarius). The church had this weird blood related hall where they bring out a vial of the blood of Saint Janurius where the blood liquifies. Supposedly, if the blood doesn't liquify DOOM will befall Naples oooooo. We also were not allowed to take pictures inside :(. As I'm writing this, I'm struggling to recall the distinctions of the interiors of the cathedrals. There were so many and they didn't necessarily have great distinguishing features.
