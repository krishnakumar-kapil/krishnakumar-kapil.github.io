We start off day 3 with the classic early morning start, since we must catch our train from [Roma Termini](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Roma+Termini/@41.9010032,12.499715,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x132f61a439c0ffef:0xa4307dbef261a994!8m2!3d41.9010032!4d12.5019037) at 9:00 am. Though we were only 10 minutes away from the station, with 3 large suitcases and a bag whose wheels didn't work -.- we had to take a taxi to the station. As usual, we had to pay a surcharge for our bags. Italy also has a city tax rule where hotels can basically charge you up to 4 euros per person per night for staying. Annoyingly, this charge is always collected in person at the hotel, which means you still end up paying out of cash or card regardless of your prior bookings.

            We reached the train station without incident, though I was falling asleep in the car. After trying to lug our bags through the cigarette smoke, we went through an abysmal security check only to realize our train was delayed by 35 minutes. Once it actually left the station, we were so amazed at how quiet and comfortable the entire journey was. Usually my dad always stays up and just stares for days outside the window, but this time all of us just slept on our journey south to Naples.

# Naples

    </div>
    <div class="8u 12u$(mobile)">
        We arrive at the city of Naples in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Garibaldi+Train+Station/@40.8528154,14.2705622,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x133b0817749b7abb:0x30f042236fe7f0f0!8m2!3d40.8528154!4d14.2727509">Garibaldi Station</a>. With our hotel only 2 minutes away and all of us stingy folks unwilling to spend on a taxi, the lugging of the luggage began with yours truly taking 2 suitcases and navigating sweatily. The station opens up to a beautiful large Piazza with an interesting glass based roof that as we later learnt was the entrance to the Napoli Metro station. As our hotels all had a check in time of around 2:00 pm we could not check-in to the hotel, and left our luggage with them taking the horribly colored cyan and orange backpack with us.

## Duomo di Napoli

    <figcaption>Duomo di Napoli</figcaption>
</div>

Napoli is a city of crowded, cramped, streets where you are the prey of the predatory motor vehicles. Looked like home. Our first stop for the day was the [Duomo di Napoli](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Naples_Cathedral). A cathedral with a massive outside wall, we weren't able to fully appreciate the size of it because the entrance was from an extremely tiny street. The church is the home of the Archbishop of Naples and is in recognition of [Saint Janurius](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Saint_Januarius). The church had this weird blood related hall where they bring out a vial of the blood of Saint Janurius where the blood liquifies. Supposedly, if the blood doesn't liquify DOOM will befall Naples oooooo. We also were not allowed to take pictures inside :(. As I'm writing this, I'm struggling to recall the distinctions of the interiors of the cathedrals. There were so many and they didn't necessarily have great distinguishing features.

### Lunch

    </div>
</div>

After our inability to go to one of the top restaurants of Rome, we decided to chance our luck in Naples. We walked down one of the busiest, yet extremely narrow, streets of Naples called Via dei Tribunali to arrive at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Antonio+e+Gigi+Sorbillo/@40.8504258,14.2546865,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x133b084247fd37e5:0x978510f3df1a87dc!8m2!3d40.8504948!4d14.2555931">Antonio e Gigi Sorbillo</a> restaurant. With an extremely large menu of options available to us, we went with 3 pizzas: the Napolitan Margherita, A pizza with capers and olives, and a pesto based pizza. We waited and waited and waited while mosquitos bit us at the legs. While we weren't particularly hungry when we arrived at the restaurant (so unusual for us), we were ravenous by the time the food came. But, every second was worth it as the pizzas were incredible. What makes the Italian Pizza incomparable to any other, is their use of high quality tomatoes, excess amounts of olive oil, and a thin fluffy base. I described the pizza as 'juicy' just due to the explosion of flavor in my mouth. In other places, we don't tend to add olive oil on top of the pizzas, but here we managed to get pizzas where the base maintained it's shape and texture with the almost liquid like surface of the pizza.


After the incredible lunch, we headed to [Piazza Bellini](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Piazza_Bellini,_Naples). A small piazza with some Colosseum like excavations underneath, it wasn't anything great.

### Church of Gesu Nuovo

    </div>
</div>

We then went to the [Church of Gesu Nuovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ges√π_Nuovo). The church has a really interesting outer facade that was unique amongst the other churches that we visited. The inside however, was more of the incredible golden arches and paintings. There also was a cloister of San Chiara nearby, but since that was paid, as usual, we skipped it.

### Toledo, the Bathroom, and the Water

We wanted to go to [Toledo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Toledo/@40.8418274,14.2478095,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x133b0850093f2839:0xf474b6b075a94d9a!8m2!3d40.8426779!4d14.2489239) station that from looking online seemed to have some incredible modern art pieces on the station walls. But, the bathroom problem arose again and we frantically tried to find one in the variety of shops along the way. Along the whole shopping district on Via Toledo there wasn't a single shop that seemed to have a public toilet. We finally went in the innovative bathroom in Toledo station. To get inside, you had to pay in coins (we only had a min of 50 cents instead of the normal 10 cents) and after entering the door would open automatically after 5 minutes!

After contemplating but not getting gelato session, we realized we had another water shortage issue and went on the hunt for a grocery store. We hilariously ended up at an American mart that unexpectedly ended up giving us some decent rates for a water bottle.

## [Galleria Umberto I](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Galleria+Umberto+I/@40.8383981,14.2475627,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xece7bc88fbc2118c!8m2!3d40.838445!4d14.2495911)

</div>

Galleria Umberto is a pubic shopping space in Naples. Italy has multiple of these massive open air malls that have large archway entrances and glass arched roofs. With the light and air pouring in, people still decided to smoke in the area much to our disappointment.

## [Piazza del Plebiscito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_del_Plebiscito)

<div class="item">

</div>

The piazza of the plebs. It was an extremely large open space with the front pillar structures looking similar to St. Peter's Square in the Vatican.

</div>

After leaving the Piazza of the Plebiscites, we had to have gelato to prove we were not amongst their ranks. The long travels of the day soon became worth it when we witnessed [Mount Vesuvius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Vesuvius) with the facade of the sea. A barrage of potential (no longer in the running) profile pictures later, we started to walk along the sea to [Castel dell'Ovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_dell%27Ovo).

## [Castel dell'Ovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_dell%27Ovo)

    </div>
</div>

A castle jutting out into the Mediterranean Sea, the height provided by the castle allowed us to see the entirety of Naples. The castle is ideally placed at the small peninsula that divides Naples as seen from a map. The castle wasn't that big, but we got to an exit point that showed the sheer drop from to sea level.

    </div>
</div>

After dell'Ovo, we walked down to our last planned site of the day that was Castel Nuovo. But after realizing that yet another place required tickets, we just admired the view from the outside. This castle was the main seat of the royal kings of Naples, Aragon, and Spain until 1815. We found the best part the engravings on the doors that had incredibly detailed drawings of battles sculpted.

---

## Metro

Completely drained from walking 8 miles, we decided to quit our walking and take the Napoli Metro back to Garibaldi station. But, the ticketing system was broken at the station and only accepted coins that we never seemed to have at the correct time. After coming back above ground, my dad decided to take a much needed espresso break before we bought tickets at a tobacco shop and boarded the train. The Garibaldi station had an amazing crisscross of escalators in the station that opened up to the glass-topped roof that I had described earlier.

### Dinner

Finally back at the hotel, we were able to check-in and catch a few breaths. The lack of dinner reservations proved to bite us quite deeply as the place we planned to go had an hour wait, which we were unwilling to do. We wanted to go to [L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele](https://www.google.com/maps/place/L'Antica+Pizzeria+da+Michele/@40.8496869,14.2630815,19z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x133b083f8db6b079:0x5ab2972d7365b642!8m2!3d40.849753!4d14.2633029), but compromised and went to the restaurant across the street [Pizzeria D'Angeli](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pizzeria+D'Angeli/@40.8496124,14.2631604,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x133b083f91ec7a8f:0x5fe0cf8bef5de044!8m2!3d40.8496124!4d14.2637076). While the descriptions looked extremely appetizing, the pizzas were some of the worst I had in Italy. The margherita ended up being a completely soggy mess, while one of the pizzas was just extremely bitter as if it was made of *karela* or bitter gourd. The last pizza was basically a giant dumping of salad vegetables with a center of buffalo mozzarella. Overall, we were extremely disappointed with the meal.

After dinner we just walked back to our hotel, [Hotel ibis Styles Napoli Garibaldi](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hotel+ibis+Styles+Napoli+Garibaldi/@40.8493148,14.266491,17z/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x0:0x58b1f4ed2bd2f6f0!5m1!1s2018-07-08!8m2!3d40.8506541!4d14.270398). The best out of the hotel's we stayed in, Ibis had clean, large, and modern rooms with thankfully good wifi. They had these foot activated floor lamps that I'm really interested in getting for myself. A random suggestion for travellers would be to remember to bring a multi-port cable extender with just one travel adaptor. This saved us so much trouble throughout our trip.
