**Summary**: Milan, Porto Nuovo, Sempione Park, Piazza Scala

---

We tried going to the Duomo to see inside the main cathedral, but it only opened at 10 am, while our train to Milan was at 11. Stuck in a massive line, we managed to meet an Australian couple with whom we spoke about how expensive Australian flights are and of course cricket. As the line was extremely long, we sadly didn't get a chance to go inside the cathedral by the time we had to head back to the hotel to leave for the train station.

We boarded our train to Milan and promptly fell asleep due to how comfortable the Frecciarossa trains were. On arrival in Milan, we lugged the suitcases painfully to the hotel. [Hotel Demo]() gave us a room that was smaller than a college dorm, where we literally had to jump over beds to get to the bathroom and a cupboard. We luckily managed to get a larger room after arguing about the size of the hotel.

Starving, we headed off to find some lunch in the direction of downtown in the city. After multiple rejections of restaurants, we settled on a small cafe that had a buffet style pasta menu where we got a spaghetti, couscous and a dish full with eggplants and zucchini that I couldn't finish.

We initially wanted to go to a famous cemetery with many sculptures, but thankfully google maps told us just before we left that it was closed for the day.

## Porto Nuovo

Just before Porto Nuovo, a modern shopping area, we got a chance to see [Bosco Verticale](). These two towers are residential buildings that are filled with trees on the sides of the building, giving them an incredible look. Honestly, it would be a dream to live in one of these towers. 

Porto Nuovo is a small shopping area with a nice fountain in the middle and astonishingly modern buildings surrounding it. Yet, the Italian bathroom problem arose where not a single public bathroom was available.

## Sempione Park

Our tired legs got a chance to rest at Sempione Park, a massive park in Milan with castles and ponds. The park also contains Sforzesco Castle, now an art museum that we visited the next day.

The rest of the day was spent just visiting more Piazzas in Milan. We got our first sights of the famous Duomo di Milano as well on that day. We then headed to Galleria Vittorio Emmanuel II, Piazza Scala, before heading to Pizzeria Maruzella for dinner. After a hefty meal of pizzas, bread, and mom trying some wine, we headed back to the hotel exhausted from our travels.
