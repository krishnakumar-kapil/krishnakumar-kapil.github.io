**Summary**: Pompeii, Amalfi Coast

---

With a tour of Pompeii and the Amalfi Coast starting at 8:00 am, the sleepy K family awoke at the unholy hour of 6:00 am to get ready to reach our pick up point at 7:45 am. The breakfast at Hotel Ibis Styles was excellent due to them simply having a toaster for once. After the breakfast, we stumbled sleepily to the pickup point at Hotel UNA in the square, blearily trying to figure out whether this is the actual pick up point. 8:00 am comes and goes and we haven't seen any tour pickups. Some buses come but they weren't with our pickup. Finally, this massive bus with city tour on it comes up and while we initially dismissed it, it turned out to be our ride. 

We wasted more time picking around people from all over the city before starting the journey Pompeii.

        <p>For those that may not know, Pompeii was a famous city destroyed in 79 AD by a volcano next to the city called Mt. Vesuvius, that has since been dormant. The citizens didn't actually know that the mountain was a volcano.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our first stop, instead of the last, was a souvenir shop for people to buy Pompeiian helmets and shells. The shells are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_(carving)"><i>Cameos</i></a>.</p>

**Training and Amphitheater::** Our first stop was the training grounds of the gladiators and slaves who fought in the amphitheater. The people would get housing, equipment, and meals from the rich, famous or political figures in Pompeii to fight as entertainment to retain their owners status. We next went to the amphitheater where we learned how little change our culture has had in terms of sexism. Only men of ranking and power were allowed to sit closest to the stage. Women were restricted to the top third of the amphitheater with children. The amphitheater also had perfect acoustics from the center of the stage, which was demonstrated by a clap by the tour guide. I think the circular nature of the seats allowed this.

**Roads:** All the roads in Pompeii were cobblestone paths with large stones that chariots would ride on. Pompeii had its own version of the zebra crossing where they would keep large stones as a way for pedestrians to cross as well as for chariots to slow down. The stones made it easier for pedestrians to cross the road when rains or sewage would clog the road up. The main road in Pompeii ran straight for around 5 km and was seen to divide the town in two.

        <strong>Shops:</strong> The shops in Pompeii were separated on the basis of the type of entrance that they used. Expensive or fancy shops would use expensive white marble in the entryway. Something surprising was that the Pompeiians had access to sliding doors that would be sculpted in the doorway that was used when the shops would close. Most of these shops had the owners staying in homes above the shops, similar to many places today Most of these shops had the owners staying in homes above the shops, similar to many places today. We got to see a baker's shop with an oven for pizza or bread. Pompeii also had the concept of free parking for their horses! Outside shops in the entranceway they would create small holes where ropes could be looped through for keeping their horses in place while the customer could shop.

<!-- <public_water> -->

<div class="row">
    <div class="8u 12u$(mobile)">
        <p><strong>Water:</strong> Pompeii also had public water drinking facilities, something modern Italy could definitely learn from! They would have public water fountains at the side of road intersections with drinking water for the public. There's a spot on the stone fountain which was completely smooth due to sheer usage. The water was distributed throughout the city using lead pipes. If Vesuvius hadn't erupted, this easily could've caused the citizens a lot of harm. We still haven't learned our lesson with current cities like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis">Flint</a> still have large amounts of lead in their water. </p>
        <p><strong>Baths:</strong> Our next destination was the famous Roman baths. These were used by common citizens for pleasure but also used by businessmen as meeting points. The baths were free for all citizens in the city as another one of the free amenities provided by the government in the city. The baths also contained a spa-like room where the temperature was maintained at 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). The temperature was maintained in the room through an underground structure that when heated would pass heated steam to the main spa room through lead pipes. </p>

**Brothel** Our tour guide spent an extraordinary amount of time on these facilities haha. Definitely, awkward getting told about these with your parents. But, historically these were used for sailors who came to the Pompeii Port and would need a place to stay. The matriarch of the *[Lupanar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupanar_(Pompeii))*(brothel) would ensure that all sailors would have to pass through her to get the best deals for a room (and also a prostitute).

**Main Forum**: Our group then went to the main forum in Pompeii with the broken Temple of Jupiter and Vesuvius hidden in the clouds in the background. Whilst leaving we managed to get a quick picture of a top-level view of a 3d model of the ruins of Pompeii.

Our tour included lunch that was either pizza or spaghetti (our first in Italy!) with some incredible lemon gelato. We then spent a lot of time waiting for the groups to split into the respective tours for the respective day: a tour of Vesuvius, wine tasting in Vesuvius, Capri and finally Amalfi Coast (us!).

## Amalfi Coast and the Terrible Bus

We finally got into a small van like bus and departed for our journey to the Amalfi Coast. Initially, the bus was fine but it's A/C seemed to go kaput. In a bus without openable windows, the bus quickly turned into a Roman sauna. With the driver driving like a possessed maniac on tight roads with a steep cliff on the right, the devout mother (not really :P) started her prayers haha. The only thing keeping us going was the incredible views of the Mediterranean Sea and the cities that seemed to be present right on the cliff of the sea.

    <div class="4u 12u$(mobile)">
        Our tour guide made a big point of having 3 different stops with a <i>special</i> surprise stop wooooah. It was just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limoncello">limoncello</a> factory. As a family who doesn't really drink, it wasn't that interesting though the views from the location were quite nice.
    </div>
</div>

2 stops, insane driving and dripping of sweat, we realized that a traffic accident was making our progress excruciatingly slow. The road along the Amalfi coast is basically a 1.5 lane road on a cliff without alternate paths. With such driving, it isn't surprising that such incidents happen, though our guide was vehement in his denial of such.

We finally reached the city of Amalfi 3 hours later at 5 pm. There was nothing like stepping out into the cool sea breeze of Amalfi after the sweltering heat of the bus. Amalfi, like a lot of the cities we saw, is at the boundary of a cliff and the sea. We hadn't seen a city like that where it is basically part of the mountain and the sea together. I can definitely see a city like this being highly defensible against land and sea assaults in the past. We saw some hints of this with some small fort-like structures here and there.

After getting some much needed cold gelato in us, we started walking in the city in the hunt for both water and coffee. Amma decided to buy some excellent lemon candy since Amalfi is famous for them. After coming down to the pier and the waterside, the above photo session ensued. My parents were also incredibly and surprisingly curious about drones after seeing another tourist flying one. After an hour of fun, we got back into the aptly named *Mamma Mia* bus after all the difficulties it caused us.

The ride back over the mountains was incredible as we went through the clouds seen earlier to see the city of Naples through the clouds. We managed to get back to Naples without issue, but the guide decided to use quite possibly the worst drop off algorithm for the passengers. Instead of dropping off the majority of the group at the center point of the city, he decided to go to the completely opposite end of town before coming back to drop us off. We ended up arriving at the hotel at 8 pm instead of 7 because of it.

Completely exhausted from a terrible ride, we were desperate for some good food to end the day. I ended up finding a hidden gem with [Trattoria da Giovvanni](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trattoria+da+Giovanni/@40.8504997,14.2666412,16z/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x133b083e1ae8aca7:0xee28ae4217215deb!5m1!1s2018-07-08!8m2!3d40.8500896!4d14.2678432) in the side streets near our hotel. The owners are an old, Italian couple, who though unable to speak English took excellent care of us. Greeting us with a smile (it was such a rarity), they immediately brought out some incredible bruschetta and goat cheese for us to have as a starter. After explaining that we were vegetarian, we ordered spaghetti's with my dad as usual hilariously attempting to get pesto pasta even though she couldn't understand us. After such a poor bus ride, it was an incredible way to finish off the day.
