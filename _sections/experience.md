## TA in Computer Vision

I was a Teaching Assistant under Dr. Kristen Grauman for her [CS376](http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/376-spring2018/) class in the Spring of 2018. In this class, I spent time grading students assignments, grading assignments like [Visual Search System](http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/376-spring2018/assignments/a2/A2-spring2018.pdf) and [Image Segmentation](http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/376-spring2018/assignments/a4/A4-spring2018.pdf), being available to answer questions on Piazza, and grading the
tests.

## Uber Software Engineering Intern

I was on the Storage SRE team at Uber working on building a traffic mirroring system for Schemaless, Uber's distributed MySQL system that uses the RAFT protocol.
We architected a design that showed no observable impact to production latency with 100% duplication of traffic.
